            <p>“Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do
                what
                you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't
                found it
                yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.” —

                        efficient.
                        I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called Vue JS.

                        to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.</p>
